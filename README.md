oh wow, i'm not sure where to start, but here goes... just walked outta the theater, popcorn bits like some kind of crunchy refugee in my teeth. Everything's a bit of a blur, a whirlwind like a twinkling star gone haywire. Peter Pan's Neverland Nightmare – total trip. imagine if mercury in retrograde and a bad trip through the zodiac became a  .

it kicks off loud, louder than the candy stuck under my shoe, Wendy and Peter right in the thick of it. Neverland looked like my local dive bar, sticky floors and all. there's this sense of doom lurking, like a bad tarot reading but you can never leave the room. you know?? Hah! Villains twisted, not just Cap’n Hook, but shadows creeping like that nightmare when you forget your pants at the astrology meetup.

> It's so weird, really, the colors were like that time I tried rock candy laced with anxiety. fairies neon as if they hit up a rave before showing up on set. everyone was asking if they can 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   but seriously, worth the 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 while wrestlin' in messy theater seats. my back still screaming more than Tinkerbell when she’s pissed off.

dialogue? man, it kinda spiraled, words jumbling around like someone spilled my star charts. can barely remember what was said. oh! the silence, powdered sugar in the air, after a character’s big moment – felt like an eclipse that no one warned you about. there’s a drum in my head, probably the staff cleaning up, leaving me in the echo of Peter’s lost, desperate shout—almost forgot I had signed up for this emotional thunderstorm.

just — just this overwhelming sense that the sky in Neverland fell like my basket of Oracle cards after a clumsy night. leave your logic at the door, same with any popcorn expectations. you’ ll thank me later or hate me, like a cruel twist of fate not seen since Cap’n Hook’s crocodile tango.
